CET343 Android Mobile Development Assignment
This assignment contributes 100% to your final module mark and tests learning outcomes 1,2, 3 & 4.
The assessment has been designed to enable completion within a maximum time frame of 42
hours.
1. Advanced understanding of the various methodological approaches to native mobile design,
including different programming languages, storage designs and appropriate native mobile
standards.
2. Comparative knowledge of design and development techniques for the design of native mobile
applications and storage systems
3. Ability to plan, analyse, design, build and implement a media and interaction rich native mobile
application in a chosen domain
4. Ability to plan, develop and implement an integrated testing and evaluation strategy accounting
for user experience, data integrity and network performance issues.
This assignment is split into three parts. Part A is worth 30 marks and is an analysis, design,
functionality, testing and evaluation report which offers you the opportunity to discuss your app’s life
cycle, functionality against the requirements, present your testing results and evaluate the overall
success. Part B is worth 60 marks and this offers you the opportunity to create the app you have
designed. The final section, Part C, is worth 10 marks and gives you the opportunity to demonstrate
your app.
The deadline for this assignment is available on Canvas. Please submit to the assignment space on
canvas.Scenario
FitLife
You have been commissioned to create an app that assists users in planning their weekly workouts
while allowing them to create a personalized fitness checklist. This app enables users to input their
favourite workout routines, including exercises, equipment needed, instructions, and pictures. It also
features a workout checklist generator that consolidates all exercises and equipment required for the
selected routines. Users can delegate tasks such as training reminders to friends, track expenses
(e.g., gym fees, supplements), and even integrate with fitness platforms or local gyms for class
availability.
Typical User Interactions
John is a busy professional who wants to stay consistent with his fitness goals despite his busy
schedule. He searches for workout planning apps on the Play Store and discovers FitLife. After
downloading the app, he registers for an account and logs in.
Inside the app, John begins by browsing a selection of workout routines. He selects several sessions
for the week, including “Full-Body Strength Training”, “HIIT Cardio”, and “Morning Yoga Flow”. For
each routine, he reviews the required equipment (dumbbells, yoga mat, resistance bands) and saves
them to his weekly workout plan. The app automatically generates a checklist that includes all the
necessary equipments, organized by category (e.g., strength equipment, mats, accessories).
Knowing that he won’t always have time to prepare his equipments, John decides to delegate part of
the task to his friend Mark, who often trains with him. He selects the checklist and uses the delegation
feature to send Mark a text message containing the list of equipment to bring along, along with a
reminder of which gym provides which equipment.
A few days later, while browsing a fitness blog, John discovers a new workout routine for “Core
Strengthening Pilates”. He shares the link directly to FitLife, which pulls in the exercises and adds
them to his workout plan and equipment checklist.
John also uses the app’s geotagging feature to mark his favourite workout spots like the university
gym, a nearby park, and a yoga studio, so he can quickly decide where to train. As he completes his
sessions, he marks exercises as “done” in the checklist, ensuring he stays on track. The app also
provides reminders for upcoming workout sessions and rest days, helping him stay consistent.
By the end of the week, John is proud of how easy it was to plan and follow his fitness schedule,
manage his equipment, and stay motivated using FitLife. The app gave him more structure in his
training, making fitness a natural part of his routine.
You are required to develop a prototype application for the Android operating systems which will
include all the core requirements.The prototype
Core requirements of the app:
● Home screen - the point of entry for your app.
● User registration and login
● Manage my items (the ability to manage exercises and workout routines):
○ Delete items – e.g. remove unwanted workouts or exercises.
○ Edit items – e.g. update exercise details (e.g., number of sets, reps, or instructions).
○ Mark items as completed (done) – check off exercises or workouts once finished.
● Create a workout routine – users can create custom workouts by inputting exercises, required
equipment, and instructions (with the option of adding images).
● Item Delegation - the ability to send a workout equipment list or exercise checklist or routine
reminders as an SMS to another phone/contact
● Implement only one desirable feature from the following list below:
○ Geotagging – the ability to geotag gyms, yoga studios, or parks so workout routines
and checklists can be linked to a location and viewed on a map.
○ Integration with other apps – allow integration with fitness or wellness apps/blogs so
that exercises or routines from other apps can be imported into FitLife.
○ Gesture controls – include at least three gestures to improve management of
exercises (e.g., swipe left to delete an exercise, swipe right to mark as complete, shake
to reset the workout list).
There is no associated logo or house style for this app yet so you have free reign over the
appearance, but pay particular attention to Material Design.Part A - Analysis, design, functionality, testing and evaluation (30 marks)
A technical report should be submitted. The document should include the following sections:
● Front report page. Include name, userID, registration number and programme.
● Analysis. This section requires you to provide a comparative evaluation of the various
approaches to mobile app design and development, including operating systems, options for
different programming languages, storage designs and appropriate native mobile standards. Your
comparison should consider iOS and Android based solutions at a minimum. You should support
your discussion with academic references. This section should be in the region of 750 words.
● Design. This section should show your screen hierarchy, plus wireframe design and menu /
layout details. You should critically evaluate how your design matches current Material Design
principles and UX trends. Screenshots of XML layouts created in Android Studio are not
acceptable and will receive no marks.
● Functionality. Provide detail on key elements of your application’s functionality with a breakdown
of key examples of coding logic, ie how it works. You should give a clear description of the
implementation, including storage requirements and external APIs used (if relevant), and justify
your design and implementation choice.
● Test Strategy and Test Results. Summarise your strategy for testing and include a testing table
of tests and their results.
● Evaluation. Comment on the success of your implementation and make recommendations for
improvements.
Part B - Build of the mobile Android app - (60 marks)
The completed prototype app should be submitted. The application should be native and work well on
an Android phone or tablet device. For the purpose of this project all data persistence can be local but
it is encouraged to implement cloud solutions for data persistence.
Your prototype should include all of the core requirements mentioned in the scenario. Please only
attempt one desirable feature from the provided list only, as marks will only be awarded for one. You
must make it clear which desirable feature you have attempted.
Please ensure that all code (XML and Java / Kotlin) is commented appropriately and that you have
packaged the app successfully before submitting a zipped project file to canvas.
Part C - Demo (10 marks)
You are required to demonstrate your app with a screencast recording. This should be no longer than
10 minutes. The purpose of this demonstration is to:
● To showcase the application and how well you have met the core requirements and the
desirable feature requirement.
● To demonstrate any issues identified during testing which have not yet been resolved.Submission
The deadline for submission is available on Canvas.
Following the new requirements for assignment submissions, you are required to fill out the academic
declaration form which is available on Canvas.
